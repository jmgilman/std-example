# Just like we place buildables in `apps.nix`, it's standard to place our

# consumers of our repository. If you're not familiar with the idea of a
# development shell, it's essentially a self-contained environment that can be
# configured to provide all the tools and dependencies needed to work on our
# project. It solves the vital problem of, "works on my machine."

  # This is a small wrapper around the numtide/devshell `mkShell` function and

  # result of this map is a attribute set where the value is a proper
  # development shell derivation.
